# Data-Structures-Codes
Here you'll find some interesting codes for topics related to data structures and algorithms

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.
From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms −

1.Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.
2.Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.
3.Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.
4.Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.
5.Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.


Built-in Data Type
Those data types for which a language has built-in support are known as Built-in Data types. For example, most of the languages provide the following built-in data types.
Integers
Boolean (true, false)
Floating (Decimal numbers)
Character and Strings

Derived Data Type
Those data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are known as derived data types. These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them. For example −
List
Array
Stack
Queue
